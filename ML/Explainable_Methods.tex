\textbf{Explainability methods}

\textit{Random Forests}

Random Forests consists in constructing several trees and deducing the features that are used to construct the best tree. --> we can thus use it for feature importance method.

\textit{LIME}

Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations
Main idea: understanding the model by perturbing the input of data samples

Important: Inputs should be in human-readable format (e.g. vector or image)

Ouput: list of explanations

approximation of a model LOCALLY (?) with an interpretable one (e.g. linear model, decision tree)

- interpretable models are trained on small perturbations (= locally!) -> should provide a good local approximation
