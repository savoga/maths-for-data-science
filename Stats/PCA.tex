The PCA's objective is to get an approximation of a set of points in a \textbf{low} dimensional set. \\

\underline{Inertia} \\

Inertia $I_M = \Sigma_{i=1}^n p_i ||x_i - g||_M^2$ \\

where $g^T = (\bar{x}^{(1)},...,\bar{x}^{(p)})$ also called the \textit{gravity center}. \\

--> The inertia is thus the weighted average of the squared distance of each observation with the gravity center. \\

--> $p_i$ is the weight given to each observation. Most of the times, $p_i = \frac{1}{n}$ (every observation contributes equally to the analysis) \\

-->  the distance $||.||$ depends on the choosen metric $M$ \\

If the data are centered:
$$I_M = \Sigma_{i=1}^n p_i x_i^T M x_i$$

Since $I_M \in \mathbb{R}$:
$$I_M = Tr(\Sigma_{i=1}^n p_i x_i^T M x_i)$$

Thanks to the trace properties:
$$I_M = Tr(\Sigma_{i=1}^n M x_i p_i x_i^T)$$

With $V = Cov(X)$:
$$I_M = Tr(MV)$$

\underline{Projection} \\

In order to represent the set of points in a low dimensional set, we use projections. \\

The projection should distort the initial set the less as possible, that is:

=> reduce the projection distances as much as possible

=> maximize the average of squared distances between projected points

=> maximize inertia of the projected points \\

In the below figure, maximizing the inertia leads to choosing the projection on the right since d2 > d1.

Let $P$ a projector. $V = Cov(X) = X^TDX$ (with $D$ the weight matrix). The covariance matrix of the projected points is:

$$V_P = (PX)^TD(PX) = (XP^T)^TD(XP^T) = PX^TVXP^T = PVP^T$$ \\

\textit{Note}: a projector $P$ is such that $P^2=P$ and $PM = MP^T$ \\

\underline{Optimisation} \\

As seen previously, the objective is to maximize the inertia. Combining the previous 2 paragraphs, we can express the inertia of projected points:

$$Ip_M = Tr(V_pM) = Tr(PVP^TM)$$

$Tr(PVP^TM) = Tr(PVMP)$ since $PM = MP^T$

$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~= Tr(VMP^2)$ since $Tr(AB) = Tr(BA)$

$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~= Tr(VMP)$ since $P^2 = P$ \\

Thus the optimisation problem is:

$$max~Ip_M = max~Tr(VMP)$$
